    "We're going to be creating SRS ratings for the 2019 season, but you should be able to go back and use the same code to generate ratings for prior seasons quite easily after getting through this. Remember, the main two data points that SRS is concerned with are scoring margin and SOS. We'll be calculating the latter as part of the base SRS calculation. As for the former, score data is very easily accessed via the CFBD API's /games endpoint. Let's use Python's request library to load all games from the 2019 season into a pandas DataFrame object."

There are a few different options. For one, we can just include them but then our system of equations grows much larger and includes teams that offer very few data points. Sports Reference takes the approach of just tossing all non-FBS teams into a bucket and treating them as a single team. I don't really like that much because even still, not all FCS teams are the same. We're just going to exclude them. CFBD has an, admittedly, peculiar way of distinguishing FCS teams. Looking in the conference columns above, you'll see that all non-FBS teams have a null conference value, which Python represents are 'None'. Let's go ahead and filter out any games where either team has no conference data and thus are non-FBS schools."

Another admitted peculiarity of the CFBD API at the time of writing is that it does not have a flag for completed games. Instead, we need to filter out games lacking score data.

    "Before we get any further, I'd be remiss if I didn't give a shout out to Andrew Mauboussin as a lot of what follows is based on a GitHub repo of his to which someone on Patreon had pointed me. Now that we have the data in the state in which we want it to be, the final steps are to go ahead and perform the SRS calculations. Remember, we will be building a system of 130 equations with 130 unknown variables (so a 130 x 130 matrix). To once again quote Doug Drinen's primer, which was mainly concerned with NFL:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The idea is to define a system of 32 equations in 32 unknowns. The solution to that system will be collection of 32 numbers and those numbers will serve as the ratings of the 32 NFL teams. Define R_ind as Indianapolis' rating, R_pit as Pittsburgh's rankings, and so on. Those are the unknowns. The equations are:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> R_ind = 12.0 + (1/16) (R_bal + R_jax + R_cle + . . . . + R_ari)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> R_pit = 8.2 + (1/16) (R_ten + R_hou + R_nwe + . . . . + R_det)\n",

    "> R_stl = -4.1 + (1/16) (R_sfo + R_ari + R_ten + . . . . + R_dal)\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    "> One equation for each team. The number just after the equal sign is that team's average point margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extrapolate this to the 130 teams in FBS. By solving this system of equations, we will find each team's adjusted rating which incorporates scoring margin and strength. I once had a Linear Algebra professor tell me that his course would be the most important undergraduate math course I would ever take. I was dubious then, not so much now.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's actually not so bad. In order to build up our system of equations, we are going to define two arrays. The first array will define the coefficients for our system of equations and will have dimensions of 130 x 130. The second array will house our solutions and thus be 130 x 1 (one rating for each team). Go ahead and run this code."
